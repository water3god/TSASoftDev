        <h1>Environmental Issues</h1>
        <p>There are many environmental issues that have different effects on the world we live in. Learn about them here
            then go to the next page to find out how we can help.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fossil Fuel Dependence <p>Our world relies very heavily on fossil fuels that are detrimental to drill and
                    release CO2 when burned. This CO2 is a greenhouse gas, trapping heat in our atmosphere. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Plastic pollution <p>In 2015, we produced 419 million tons of plastic. About 14 million tons per year ends
                    up in the ocean per year. Plastic breaks down to microplastics and these deplete the overall water
                    quality. Plastic products also do not biodegrade, so they will be there forever unless we do something
                    about it. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Climate Change <p>Climate change has brought upon many negative impacts to our environment such as droughts
                and flooding. Enviroments such as the arctic are most vulnerable due to warming being twice as fast as the 
                global average. Many environments home to a variety of species aresuffering from climate change.
                Invasive species may start to come thrive in affected environments due to the environment being more detail
                because of climate change. With the help of everyone supporting the reduction of emissions to zero caused by
                greenhouse gas emissions, warming will be limited and wil help combat climate change. </p> 
            </li>
            <li>
                What you can do <p>Teach others to be more aware of climate change. Find enviornmentally friendly alternatives to technologies
                you use. Instead of using a car, consider biking or walking. Save energy whenever you can. Turn of your lights
                and AC when you are not using them. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Environmental Issues</h1>
    </div>
    <p id="description">There are many environmental issues that have different effects on the world we live in. Learn
        about them here
        then go to the next page to find out how we can help.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fossil Fuel Dependence <p>Our world relies very heavily on fossil fuels that are detrimental to drill and
                release CO2 when burned. This CO2 is a greenhouse gas, trapping heat in our atmosphere. </p>
        </li>
        <li>Plastic Pollution <p>In 2015, we produced 419 million tons of plastic. About 14 million tons per year ends
                up in the ocean per year. Plastic breaks down to microplastics and these deplete the overall water
                quality. Plastic products also do not biodegrade, so they will be there forever unless we do something
                about it. </p>
        </li>
        <li>Climate Change <p>Climate change has brought upon many negative impacts to our environment such as droughts
                and flooding. Enviroments such as the arctic are most vulnerable due to warming being twice as fast as
                the
                global average. Many environments home to a variety of species aresuffering from climate change.
                Invasive species may start to come thrive in affected environments due to the environment being more
                detail
                because of climate change. </p>
        </li>
        <li>Ocean Acidification <p>Ocean Acidification refers to oceans absorbing 30% of carbon dioxide released
                into
                the Earth's atmosphere. PH levels lower and if they become too low, organisms that thrive in the
                ocean such as
                oysters could have their shells and skeletons dissolve. Rising global temperatures and plastic
                pollution also
                cause ocean acidification. If other environmental issues are not limited, then more issues like
                ocean acidification
                will appear more and more. </p>
        </li>
        <li>Deforestation <p>Through limiting deforestation can forests continue to thrive and avoid extinction.
                With the
                help of people willingly planting seeds for trees near forests going through deforestation to grow,
                certain parts of
                forests will be limited from being cut down while the other parts are permitted so the effects of
                forests being
                able to combat soil erosion will still be present while people can still cut down trees without
                impacting the environment
                more negatively. </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Environmental Issues</h1>
    <p>There are many environmental issues that have different effects on the world we live in. Learn about them here
        then go to the next page to find out how we can help.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fossil Fuel Dependence <p>Our world relies very heavily on fossil fuels that are detrimental to drill and
                release CO2 when burned. This CO2 is a greenhouse gas, trapping heat in our atmosphere. </p>
        </li>
        <li>Plastic pollution <p>In 2015, we produced 419 million tons of plastic. About 14 million tons per year ends
                up in the ocean per year. Plastic breaks down to microplastics and these deplete the overall water
                quality. Plastic products also do not biodegrade, so they will be there forever unless we do something
                about it. </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

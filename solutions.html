        <h1>Environmental Issues</h1>
    </div>
    <p id="description">There are many environmental issues that have different effects on the world we live in. Learn
        about them here
        then go to the next page to find out how we can help.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fossil Fuel Dependence <p>With the usage of carbon taxes (tax on carbon emission released from burning fossil fuels), 
        carbon emissions are being used less and limits the rise of global temperature. </p>
        </li>
        <li>Plastic Pollution <p> With the help of all communites pitching in and helping collect plastic, the dire effects 
        that plastic pollution has can be limited. </p>
        </li>Climate Change <p>With the help of everyone supporting the reduction of emissions caused by
            greenhouse gas emissions, warming will be limited and wil help combat climate change. </p>
        </li>Ocean Acidification <p>Through limiting plastic pollution and global warming, ocean acidification 
            can be prevented or at least slowed. The carbon tax and communities pitching in solutions also 
            help to combat ocean acidification as they combat plastic pollution and global warming.</p>
        </li>Deforestation <p>Through limiting deforestation can forests continue to thrive and avoid extinction. With the
         help of people willingly planting seeds for trees near forests going through deforestation to grow, certain parts of 
            forests will be limited from being cut down while the other parts are permitted so the effects of forests being 
            able to combat soil erosion will still be present while people can still cut down trees without impacting the environment 
            more negatively. </p>
    </ul>
